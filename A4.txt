Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a triangle having sides of 3, 4 and 5 units by
creating a class named 'Triangle' with the constructor having the three sides as its parameters.

#include <iostream>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;
class triangle 
{
public:
 triangle  (int a,int b,int c)
{
	float ar=((a+b+c)/2.0),area=sqrt(ar*(ar-a)*(ar-b)*(ar-c));
	cout<<"Area of a triangle is: "<<area<<"\n";
	cout<<"Perimeter of a triangle is: "<<a+b+c;
}
};
int main() 
{
  triangle  tr1(3,4,5);
}

output:-
Area of a triangle is: 6
Perimeter of a triangle is: 12
