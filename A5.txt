Write a program to print the area of two rectangles having sides (4,5) and (5,8) respectively by
creating a class named 'Rectangle' with a function named 'Area' which returns the area. Length and
breadth are passed as parameters to its constructor.


#include <iostream>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;
class rectangle 
{
public:
    void area(int a,int b);
};

void rectangle ::area(int a,int b)
{
	float area= a*b;
	cout<<"\nArea of a rectangle  is: "<<area;
}


int main() 
{
  rectangle  r1,r2;
	r1.area(4,5);
	r2.area(5,8);
}
output:-
Area of a rectangle  is: 20
Area of a rectangle  is: 40
